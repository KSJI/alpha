Our project is a website that uploads pictures of food and analyzes the colors in the image, checking to see how healthy the plate is.  More colors on the place = more healthy.  One of our stretch goals is to allow these pictures to be uploaded to a stream where other users can view and like other’s photos.

Our goal is to make a social impact by transforming our current society where fast food, obesity, and health problems are at a high rise into a healthier society by changing people’s diets.
